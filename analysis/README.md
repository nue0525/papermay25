Key Dependency Insights:

Dependency Structure:

Root Node: PostgreSQL (no dependencies) - serves as the data source
Middle Node: Expression (depends on PostgreSQL) - transformation layer
Leaf Node: PostgreSQL1 (depends on Expression) - final destination


Parent-Child Relationships:

   PostgreSQL (342cc1a8...) 
   └── Expression (6cbc8c1b...)
       └── PostgreSQL1 (0e5c8da9...)

Execution Flow Validation:

The sequence numbers (1→2→3) correctly match the dependency order
No circular dependencies detected
Clean linear pipeline flow


Node Roles:

PostgreSQL: Source/Root - reads from employees table
Expression: Transform/Middle - processes data with field mappings
PostgreSQL1: Target/Leaf - writes to employees_target table


Dependency Validation:

All nodes have proper dependency chains
No orphaned nodes
Execution order respects dependencies



The analysis now properly maps the node IDs to their actual relationships, showing how data flows from the source PostgreSQL table through the Expression transformation node to the target PostgreSQL table. This creates a clear ETL pipeline with proper dependency management.
