🎯 Expression Node Enhancement Opportunities
📊 Date Calculations (High Value)

Age at hire: EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(hire_date, birth_date))
Current age: EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, birth_date))
Tenure years: EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, hire_date))

📈 Performance Analytics (Business Value)

Performance categories: Excellent/Good/Satisfactory/Needs Improvement
Experience levels: Senior/Mid-Level/Junior/Entry Level

🔍 Data Validation (Quality Assurance)

Data quality flags: Detect missing names, invalid dates
Processing timestamps: Track when records were transformed

🔥 High Priority Optimizations

Implement Expression Error Handling

Add TRY-CATCH blocks for complex expressions
Prevents pipeline failures when you add business logic


Fix Target Data Types

Keep hire_date and birth_date as date types (not varchar)
Better performance for future date calculations



⚡ Medium Priority Enhancements

Add Expression Execution Metrics

Track transformation success rates
Monitor performance of complex expressions


Implement Data Validation Layer

Validate data quality before transformations
Early detection of data issues



The analysis now treats your Expression node as a strategic component ready for business logic expansion, rather than suggesting its removal. This prepares your pipeline for the planned expression updates while maintaining optimal performance and reliability.
