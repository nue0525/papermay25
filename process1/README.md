Key Components Created:
1. Enhanced Database Schema (database_schema)

New PostgreSQL tables for storing workflow metadata
Extends existing tables with Prefect integration fields
Views and functions for efficient querying
Proper indexing for performance

2. Prefect Tasks (prefect_tasks)

postgres_extract_task - Extract data using Polars (10-30x faster than Pandas)
postgres_load_task - Load data with Polars processing
expression_transform_task - Apply transformations using Polars expressions
store_workflow_metadata_task - Store workflow configuration in PostgreSQL
update_metrics_task - Track execution metrics and data lineage

3. Prefect Flows (prefect_flows)

workflow_execution_flow - Main dynamic orchestration flow
metadata_storage_flow - Store workflow metadata on creation
Dynamic dependency resolution using topological sorting
Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling

4. Refactored Service (prefect_workflow_run_service)

WorkflowRunPrefect class maintaining API compatibility
Enhanced reporting with PostgreSQL queries
Prefect flow cancellation for stopping workflows
Real-time status enrichment from Prefect API

5. Migration & Deployment (migration_deployment_guide)

Complete migration script from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
Prefect deployment creation
Infrastructure setup guide
Health checking and monitoring utilities

Major Improvements:
Performance Benefits:

Polars: 10-30x faster data processing than Pandas
PostgreSQL: Faster querying than MongoDB for structured data
Concurrent execution: Prefect's native concurrency support
Lazy evaluation: Polars' memory-efficient processing

Observability Benefits:

Prefect UI: Visual flow monitoring and debugging
Enhanced metrics: Data lineage, memory usage, execution times
Artifacts: Automatic generation of execution summaries
Real-time status: Live updates from Prefect API

Reliability Benefits:

Automatic retries: Configurable retry policies at task level
State persistence: Robust failure recovery
Dependency management: Native topological sorting
Error handling: Comprehensive exception management

Migration Path:

Run database schema setup
Execute migration script to move metadata from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
Deploy Prefect infrastructure (server, workers, database)
Update service imports to use WorkflowRunPrefect
Test workflow execution with new system
Monitor and optimize using Prefect UI and PostgreSQL queries

The refactored system maintains full backward compatibility with your existing APIs while providing significantly better performance, observability, and reliability. The use of Polars for data processing and PostgreSQL for metadata storage will give you substantial performance improvements, especially for large datasets.
